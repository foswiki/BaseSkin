---++ Modular skin parts
Base Skin is built with modular parts. Each of these parts corresponds with a view template.

%TABLE{columnwidths="10%,50%,40%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Part* | *Functionality* | *Template* |
| =base=   | Base structure of skin templates | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseSkinViewTemplate (this loads %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseSkinCommonTemplate) |
| =basecss= | Loads CSS files that implement Foswiki styles | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseCssSkinViewTemplate |
| =basecssgrid= | Loads CSS files that implement a column and typographic grid to facilitate topic markup. The column grid reformats the layout for different screen sizes. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseCssGridSkinViewTemplate |
| =basejs= | Loads Javascript files that implement dynamic interaction with topic contents | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseJsSkinViewTemplate |

These parts can be loaded independently, as long as the rules for the skin path are met. A skin is set using skin path elements, from specific to generic.

For example:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = basecss,base
</pre>

When you are developing your own skin on top of the "full" Base Skin, your skin will be the most specific skin part. The skin path then becomes:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = myskin,%SKIN_PATH%
</pre>

How to choose the right skin parts from Base Skin? The table below describes what you can expect.

%TABLE{columnwidths="30%,5%,30%,35%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Skin setting* | *Try* | *What do you see* | *Why would I need this* |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%base%ENDCOLOR%= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=base][test]] | No CSS or Javascript is loaded, also not from plugins. | You are building something from scratch using the bare minimum. You might be developing a new skin that uses Foswiki's template structure, but you are building your own CSS and Javascript from the ground up. | 
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basecss%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basecss,base][test]] | Foswiki styles like =foswikiNotification= and =foswikiAlert= are implemented. Table styles from !TablePlugin are loaded as well. | You are using Foswiki topic contents and it would be handy to have some styles defined. You are developing your own application with your own Javascript. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basejs%ENDCOLOR%,basecss,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,basecss,base][test]] | !TwistyPlugin and JQuery's =TABPANE= (form and attachment tabs) are working. | You want to use Foswiki's functionalities like dynamic topic interaction. You might be developing your own skin, adding custom CSS on top. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basecssgrid%ENDCOLOR%,basejs,basecss,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basecssgrid,basejs,basecss,base][test]] | Better styling. Resize the page to see reformatting for different screen sizes. | You like to start out with a better defined basic style, but you will add your own CSS styling on top. |

---++ Background
This skin has all templates as topics. This makes it easier to have access to template code. The downside is that template topics will be searchable and will show up in search results.

   * =basecssgrid= loads:
      * =typographic.css=: baseline grid generated code from http://topfunky.com/baseline-rhythm-calculator/ (modified). This file also defines a couple of spacing-related styles for Foswiki CSS classes. %RED% Not all Foswiki classes have been defined. Especially button classes need some work. %ENDCOLOR%
      * =columngrid.css=: generated from [[http://lessframework.com][Less Framework]] - a cross-device CSS grid system based on using inline media queries (modified). %RED%Sidebar column code not yet implemented. %ENDCOLOR%
   * =basejs= loads nothing - yet...
   
---++ Installation Instructions
Note: this skin will not work with a Foswiki version earlier than 1.2.
