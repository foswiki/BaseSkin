---++ About Base Skin
TO WRITE

=basecss= and =basejs= use [[http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/][Twitter bootstrap]] to provide a base layer of user interface functionality.

---++ Modular skin parts
Base Skin is built with modular, progressive parts, making it possible to load only the parts you need. For instance, you might only need the CSS, not !BaseSkin's javascript.

The progressive loading is done by using a topic template for each part.

%TABLE{columnwidths="10%,50%,40%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Part name* | *What it does* | *Defined in topic template* |
| =base=   | Sets the base structure of the document (HTML page). | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseSkinFoswikiTemplate |
| =basecss= | Loads CSS file [[%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/BaseSkinCss/base_src.css][base.css]] that contains a style reset, sets default styling for HTML elements and implements Foswiki styles. %BR% =base.css= is not loaded if preference =BASESKIN_TAKE= is set to another CSS file. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BasecssSkinFoswikiTemplate |
| =basejs= | Loads a javascript file that implements dynamic interaction with topic contents. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BasejsSkinFoswikiTemplate |
| =basenocontrols= | Removes edit buttons from the page, useful for Foswiki as CMS. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BasenocontrolsSkinFoswikiTemplate |

---+++ Specifying the skin parts
Base Skin parts can be loaded independently, as long as the rules for the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Skins#Activating_Skins][skin path]] are met. As you may know, a skin is set using skin path elements, the most specific skin first.

For example:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = basejs,basecss,base
</pre>

When you are developing your own skin on top of Base Skin, your skin will be the most specific part. So the skin path will become:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = myskin,%SKIN_PATH%
</pre>

How to choose the right skin parts from Base Skin? The table below describes what you can expect.

%TABLE{columnwidths="30%,5%,30%,35%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Skin setting* | *Try* | *What do you see* | *Why would I need this* |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%base%ENDCOLOR%= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=base][test]] | No Base Skin CSS or Javascript is loaded, only that what is inserted by other extensions. | You are building something from scratch using the bare minimum. You might be developing a new skin that uses Foswiki's template structure, and you are building your own CSS and Javascript from the ground up. | 
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basecss%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basecss,base][test]] | Pages are styled. Foswiki styles like =foswikiNotification= and =foswikiAlert= are implemented. But menu dropdowns, smooth scrolling or sticky navigation won't work. | You are using Foswiki topic contents and it would be handy to have styles already defined. You are developing your own application with your own Javascript. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basejs%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,base][test]] | The page looks unstyled, but Javascript additions like smooth scrolling work. | You want to use Foswiki's Javascript functionalities but write your own stylesheets. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basejs,basecss%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,basecss,base][test]] | The page looks styled, javascript additions work. | You want to build on top of existing functionalities and perhaps make small changes to styling. |
| =Set COVER = %RED%basenocontrols%ENDCOLOR%= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,basecss,base;cover=basenocontrols][test]] | Everything works as normal, but edit and info buttons are missing. | You want to hide edit buttons from non-logged in users. Or you want to use this style to publish static HTML pages. |

The default skin setting would be:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = %SKIN_PATH%
</pre>

---++ Page structure
Pages generated by the view template are divided into a number of horizontal (screen wide) sections:
   * top bar
   * actions bar
   * topic text
   * meta info (form and attachments)
   * bottom bar

Other templates use the same structure, but will have different content for  topic and meta info.

---+++ Sections
Sections have a consistent top and bottom padding, making them easy to stack.  Sections that are at the same time a navigation bar will have different paddings.

Sections can be styled by adding a color class.

You can create a new section anywhere in a topic. For instance, to create a section with a black background, write in a topic:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:P{"endsection"}%
%TMPL:P{"startsection" class="foswikiColorBlack"}%
</verbatim>



---++ Colors

---++ Developing

---+++ LESS instead of CSS
Developing in [[http://lesscss.org][LESS]] without compiling to CSS works fine if you set:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set BASESKIN_USE_LESS = 1
</pre>
Due to the fairly large compile time in the browser I suggest to always use the compiled CSS for production sites.


---+++ Rolling your own Javascript
If you replace the default javascript, you'll need to take a few things into consideration.

---++++ Scroll javascript is needed when using a fixed top bar
Base Skin default behaviour is to let the bar scroll with the page.

But if you use Twitter's top bar style, the top bar stays glued at the top, even when the page is scrolled.

The height of the top bar will overlap the page contents. When clicking an anchor link, the anchored header would then be hidden behind the top bar. A smart scrolling script reads the top bar height and lets the page scroll just a bit less to make the anchor visible. See =base_src.js= how this works.

When no javascript is available the topic action bar will not have a fixed position and will scroll along with the page contents.



---++ Testing
---+++ Test page
A page with a lot of different markup:
   * %TEST_TOPIC%

---++ Background
This skin has all templates as topics. This makes it easier to have access to template code. The downside is that template topics will be searchable and will show up in search results.


---++ Installation Instructions
Note: this skin will not work with a Foswiki version earlier than 1.2.
