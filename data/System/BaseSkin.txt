---++ About Base Skin
TO WRITE

---++ Modular skin parts
Base Skin is built with modular, progressive parts, making it possible to load only the parts you need. For instance, you might only need the CSS, not the javascript of Base Skin.

The progressive loading is done by using a topic template for each part.

%TABLE{columnwidths="10%,50%,40%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Part name* | *What it does* | *Defined in topic template* |
| =base=   | Sets the base structure of the document (HTML page). | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseSkinViewTemplate (and this loads %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseSkinDocumentTemplate) |
| =basecss= | Loads CSS file [[%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/BaseSkinCss/base_src.css][base.css]] that contains a style reset, sets default styling for HTML elements and implements Foswiki styles. %BR% =base.css= is not loaded if preference =BASESKIN_USE_CSS_FILE= is set to another CSS file. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseCssSkinViewTemplate |
| =basecssgrid= | Loads [[%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/BaseSkinCssGrid/grid_src.css][grid_src.css]] that implements a typographic grid and an adaptive grid to cater for different screen sizes. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseCssGridSkinViewTemplate |
| =basejs= | Loads a javascript file that implements dynamic interaction with topic contents. | %SYSTEMWEB%.BaseJsSkinViewTemplate |

---+++ From specific to generic
Base Skin parts can be loaded independently, as long as the rules for the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Skins#Activating_Skins][skin path]] are met. As you may know, a skin is set using skin path elements, the most specific skin first.

For example:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = basecss,base
</pre>

When you are developing your own skin on top of the "full" Base Skin, your skin will be the most specific skin part. The skin path then becomes:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = myskin,%SKIN_PATH%
</pre>

How to choose the right skin parts from Base Skin? The table below describes what you can expect.

%TABLE{columnwidths="30%,5%,30%,35%" headeralign="left"}%
| *Skin setting* | *Try* | *What do you see* | *Why would I need this* |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%base%ENDCOLOR%= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=base][test]] | No Base Skin CSS or Javascript is loaded, only that what is inserted by other extensions. | You are building something from scratch using the bare minimum. You might be developing a new skin that uses Foswiki's template structure, and you are building your own CSS and Javascript from the ground up. | 
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basecss%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basecss,base][test]] | Basic formatting and Foswiki styles like =foswikiNotification= and =foswikiAlert= are implemented. | You are using Foswiki topic contents and it would be handy to have some styles defined. You are developing your own application with your own Javascript. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basecssgrid%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basecssgrid,basejs,basecss,base][test]] | Text is layed out for readability. Other screen sizes are supported. Resize the page to see reformatting. | Even though you are developing your own CSS, you find it useful to have the site accessible on different devices. |
| =Set SKIN = %RED%basejs%ENDCOLOR%,base= | [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,basecss,base][test]] | ... | You want to use Foswiki's functionalities like dynamic topic interaction. |

And as said above, you can also use all parts together:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set SKIN = %SKIN_PATH%
</pre>

---++ Customizing
---+++ Using different CSS
To change the default style (set with skin path parts =base= and optionally =basecssgrid=) you can either:
   1 Override the base CSS
   1 Add to the base CSS

---++++ Overriding the base style
Use a different style by pointing preference =BASESKIN_USE_CSS_FILE= to a CSS file, or to a comma-separated list of files.

For example:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set BASESKIN_USE_CSS_FILE = %<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>MAINWEB%/<nop>SitePreferences/ourbase.css,%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>MAINWEB%/<nop>SitePreferences/company.css
</pre>

---++++ Adding CSS files
Add to the default style by pointing preference =BASESKIN_ADD_CSS_FILE= to a CSS file, or to a comma-separated list of files.

For example:
<pre class="tml">
   * <nop>Set BASESKIN_ADD_CSS_FILE = %<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>MAINWEB%/<nop>SitePreferences/nicer_logo.css,%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>MAINWEB%/<nop>SitePreferences/projects.css
</pre>

---++ Testing
---+++ Test page
A page with a lot of different markup:
   * %TEST_TOPIC%

---++ Baseline grid
Pass url paramater =devgrid=1=, for instance: [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TEST_TOPIC%?skin=basejs,basecssgrid,basecss,base;devgrid=1][test baseline grid]]
   
---++ Background
This skin has all templates as topics. This makes it easier to have access to template code. The downside is that template topics will be searchable and will show up in search results.

   * CSS:
      * =base.css=: implements =FoswikiXxx= classes (see %SYSTEMWEB%.AppendixCascadingStyleSheets) and provides the most basic defaults
      * =grid.css=: implements a typographic grid
   * Javascript:
      * =basejs= loads nothing - yet...
   
---++ Installation Instructions
Note: this skin will not work with a Foswiki version earlier than 1.2.
